This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.

* [/androidApp](./androidApp/src) contains an Android application. This is where you should add
  Compose code for Android app.

* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains an iOS application. This is where you should write SwiftUI code
  for your iOS app.

* [/shared](./shared/src) is for the code that will be shared between app targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin). If required, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.
- [/androidMain](./shared/src/androidMain) is for Android specific logic.
- [/iosMain](./shared/src/iosMain) is for iOS specific logic.

### Running the apps

Use the run configurations provided by the run widget in your IDE's toolbar. You can also use these
commands and options:

- Android app: `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug`
- iOS app: open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.

### Running tests

Use the run button in your IDE's editor gutter, or run tests using Gradle tasks:

- Android tests: `./gradlew :shared:testAndroidHostTest`
- iOS tests: `./gradlew :shared:iosSimulatorArm64Test`
